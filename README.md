Magento2 provides Multi Source Inventory module that helps in managing multi warehouses. The MSI module also utilize shipping algorithms that helps in recommending best shipping algorithms based on distance or priority. More details about the MSI management is available on Magento dev docs website.

The scenario that this module donâ€™t provide is shipping cost based on the source/warehouse location of the item. The shipping cost is calculated based on the shipping origin defined at the global level. To fulfill this feature we have to buy extension that will help or use below logic.
